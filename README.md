In this project, I evaluated the potential of random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to estimate and forecast daily ET for different crops in diverse agricultural farms in the Midwest. I developed a modeling framework using data for nineteen fields where eddy covariance ET and meteorological observations in the Midwest USA were available. In this study, using satellite and remote sensing products, I applied data-driven models (random forest and long short-term memory or LSTM) with three sets of predictors (5, 11, and 16 predictors). The results of this study showed that a 16-predictor RF model outperformed a process-based land surface model for predicting. This study has shown that vapor pressure and crop coefficients were the most important predictors for irrigated crops. At the same time, short-wave radiation and enhanced vegetation index were key predictors for non-irrigated crops. My modeling architecture provided a field-scale, locally calibrated tool for accurate prediction and short-term forecasting of daily ET in areas lacking in situ ET, meteorological, and biophysical data.
