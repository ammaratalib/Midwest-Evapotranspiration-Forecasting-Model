In this project, I explored how machine learning can help farmers and land managers better understand water use on agricultural fields. I developed machine learning models using random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks—to estimate and predict daily evapotranspiration (ET), which is a key measure of how much water crops use. The study focused on 19 farms across the Midwest U.S., where we had access to satellite data and weather observations. I built a modeling framework using these data and tested how well different combinations of input features (5, 11, or 16) could predict ET. The models that used more features (16 predictors) performed best—especially the random forest model, which even outperformed a traditional physics-based model.
Some of the most important factors for accurate predictions included vapor pressure and crop type for irrigated farms, and sunlight and vegetation health for non-irrigated farms. This approach offers a powerful, field-level tool that can help monitor crop water use, even in areas where on-the-ground measurements are missing.
